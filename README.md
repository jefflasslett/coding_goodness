# My Vim colour scheme: coding_goodness

This is my colour scheme.  I’ve used something like it for most of my career.
The basic idea is that undesirable things like C preprocessor and literal values
are in ugly colours (purple, red).  Good things like comments and other code are highlighted in
pleasing colours (green, blues, cyan, gray).  It’s all on a black background for good contrast.

In its current form, it’s not perfect.  I’m using more languages than I used to and what worked for C doesn’t translate over to 
haskell, yaml, js, ruby, shell, whatever.  So the scheme needs work.
